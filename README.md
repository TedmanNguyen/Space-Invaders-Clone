# Shape Invaders 
My take of the 1978 classic Space Invaders.  
👽 Fire lasers and take down Aliens, erm shapes, to protect earth.  
⚠️ Fight through 3 difficulties, take down more and more aliens!  
🎧 8Bit sounds for immersive gameplay  

Programming stats:  
🕕 Month Long project  
📔 User Interface: Title screen, with menu navigation, and difficulty modifier  
✨ Coded collisions, normally taken care of by Unity / Unreal  
👜 Utilized Vectors and iterators to contain groups of Enemies and bullets  
💪 Focused on Object Oriented Principles, with 6 different classes and 2 derived classes
